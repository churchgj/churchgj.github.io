            <h3>Detecting and characterising an englacial conduit network within a
              temperate Swiss glacier using active seismic, ground penetrating radar
              and borehole analysis</h3>
          </header>
          <h4> Annals of Glaciology, 2019, 60(79), pp. 193–205</h4>

          <p>Englacial hydrology plays an important role in routing surface water to the glacier's
            bed and it consequently affects the glacier's dynamics. However, it is often difficult
            to observe englacial conduit conditions on temperate glaciers because of their
            short-lived nature. This journal publication demonstrates that with the use of a wide range of
            geophysical measurements, we are able to detect and characterise an englacial hydrological system.
            We use radar, sesimics and borehole measurements into the hydrological feature to
            define its geometry. From the observations, we infer that the englacial
            conduit network is fed by surface meltwater and morainal streams. The surface and
            morainal streams merge together, enter the glacier subglacially and flow through
            subglacial channels along the flank. These subglacial channels flow into highly
            efficient englacial conduits traversing the up-glacier section of the overdeepening
            before connecting with the subglacial drainage system. </p>

            <h3>Monitoring the seasonal changes of an englacial conduit network using repeated
              ground-penetrating radar measurements</h3>
          </header>
          <h4> The Cryosphere, 2020, 14(10), pp. 3269–3286 </h4>
          <img src="static/images/publication02_fig05.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>Englacial conduits act as water pathways to feed surface meltwater into the subglacial
            drainage system. A change of meltwater into the subglacial drainage system can alter
            the glacier’s dynamics. Between 2012 and 2019, I performed repeated ground-penetrating
            radar (GPR) surveys over an active englacial conduit network. The GPR data were processed
            using an impedance inversion workflow to determine the conduit’s infill material. The spatial and temporal
            evolution of the impedance inversion provided insights into the morphology of the
            Rhonegletscher’s englacial conduit network. During the summer melt seasons, we observed an
            active, water-filled, sediment-transporting englacial conduit network. We speculate
            that extensional hydraulic fracturing is responsible for the formation of the conduit
            as a result of the conduit network geometry observed and borehole observations. During
            the winter periods, the englacial conduit no longer transports water and either physically
            closed or be came very thin. Furthermore, the englacial conduit reactivated during the
            following melt season at an identical position as in the previous year.</p>

            <h3>Ground-penetrating radar imaging reveals glacier’s drainage network in 3D</h3>
          </header>
          <h4>Under Review</h4>
          <img src="static/images/publication03_fig04.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>Hydrological systems of glaciers have a direct impact on the glacier dynamics.
            Since the 1950’s, geophysical studies have provided insights into these hydrological
            systems. Unfortunately, such studies were predominantly conducted using 2D
            acquisitions along a few profiles, thus failing to provide spatially unaliased 3D
            images of englacial and subglacial water pathways. The latter has likely resulted
            in flawed constraints for the hydrological modelling of glacier drainage networks.
            In this study, I performed and presented results from a 3D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey that
            provide unprecedented high-resolution 3D images of an alpine glacier’s drainage
            network. My results did not only confirm a long-standing englacial hydrology theory
            regarding their flow paths around overdeepenings, but they also showed exciting new
            opportunities for high-resolution GPR studies of glaciers. With the development of
            unmanned aerial vehicles, I think that future 3D GPR surveys will be carried out in a fast and
            efficient manner.</p>
